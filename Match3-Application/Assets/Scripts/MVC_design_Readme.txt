After many research, i found many papers/posts about the implementation of MVC on Unity, and after reading many of them i
found one that was more cogent: https://www.toptal.com/unity-unity3d/unity-with-mvc-how-to-level-up-your-game-development.

Even though, most of this design pattern is based on that post, there is nothing write in stone when is about using MVC on Unity.

So, there is some things changed to make the pattern fit this proyect, for example, only using 4 scripts.If the proyect was bigger
ill use more making child of each Model,View or Controller respectively.
